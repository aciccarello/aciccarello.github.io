### Anthony Ciccarello's personal profile website
This repo hosts my personal website on [aciccarello.github.io](https://aciccarello.github.io).
It also serves as an excuse to push myself and use (or not use) different
technologies. In this case I am implementing a minimal website using
[Material Components for the Web](https://material.io/components/).
Included are some SVG icons from [Material Design Icons](https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline).
The logo fonts I am using are provided by [socicon](http://www.socicon.com/). Simplifying
the tool-set is an intentional exercise to help me think more about the layout and styles I use.

If there is something you would like to see on this site, please open an issue.
